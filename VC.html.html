    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p><em>This is the story</em> how i will become a <strong>software engineer</strong>.</p>
    <p>I started coding back in 2014 when my first line of code was verifing my website via pinterest verification. 
        I was so happy at what i achieved and grew more as a coder and thought to myself that this is what i wanted to do. 
        But i took me years to find the confidence in myself to pursue this</p>
